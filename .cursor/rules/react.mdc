- Avoid using interfaces for component props, use inline types instead.
- Avoid `useEffect` whenever possible in favor of making logic declarative.
- React Compiler is setup for the Studio, so basic memoization like memo, useMemo, and useCallback are not needed.
- Ignore "Incorrect class order" errors from eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss, they will be fixed automatically after your work is done.
