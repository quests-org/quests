## Project

- The Studio is an Electron app.
- The client is React 19, so use the newer APIs.
- Becuase we are trying to behave as a desktop app, we don't use `cursor: pointer` for links.
- The `src/client` folder contains the TanStack Router app, which is client-only code that only runs in the browser.
- shadcn components are installed in `@/client/components/ui`.
- Use shadcn Tailwind colors for styling, e.g. `bg-background` instead of `bg-white`.
- The app communicates over oRPC to the main process.
- We have a remote API for accounts that is also exposed via oRPC.
- `rpcClient` methods can be called directly with `.call()`, but will throw unless wrapped in `import { safe } from "@orpc/client";`
- Use `.call()` when imperative use outside React is desired.
- Use `useQuery` and `rpcClient.method.name.here.queryOptions({ input: { ... } })` for queries.
- External links can be opened with `<ExternalLink href="https://example.com" />` or `rpcClient.utils.openExternalLink`.
