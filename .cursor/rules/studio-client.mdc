## Project

- The Studio is an Electron app.
- Becuase we are trying to behave as a desktop app, we don't use `cursor: pointer` for links.
- The src/client folder contains the TanStack Router app.
- shadcn components are installed in `@/client/components/ui`.
- Use shadcn Tailwind colors for styling, e.g. `bg-background` instead of `bg-white`.
- The app communicates over oRPC to the main process.
- We have a remote API for accounts that is also exposed via oRPC.
