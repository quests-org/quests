- Avoid `any` and NEVER use `as any`.
- NEVER use non-null assertions (`!`).
- We use kebab case for filenames.
- We use non-default exports whenever possible.
- NEVER add comments for sections of JSX like `{/* Header */}<Header />`
- Objects, interfaces, types, and other sortable structures are automatically sorted by the perfectionist ESLint plugin
- DO NOT fix ESLint `perfectionist/*` issues, the editor will automatically fix them when the code is saved.
- Prefer objects for functions with many parameters.
- Don't run `tsc` to check for type errors, use your built-in diagnostics tool.

## Tailwind Rules

- Use `size-` over `w-` and `h-` when width and height are the same.
- Use `gap-x-` or `gap-y-` over `space-x` or `space-y` for gap.

## Zod Rules

- Prefer `z.output` over `z.infer` for type inference.
