Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed. For example, if you explore the repo and discover the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective. Alternatively, if you receive some test results, call this tool to brainstorm ways to fix the failing tests.",
